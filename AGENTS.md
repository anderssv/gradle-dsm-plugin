# DSM Plugin - Agent Instructions

## Release Process

Version is in `build.gradle.kts`. Development versions use `-SNAPSHOT` suffix.

To release:

1. Remove `-SNAPSHOT` from `version` in `build.gradle.kts` (e.g. `0.1.1-SNAPSHOT` → `0.1.1`)
2. Commit: `git commit -am "Release X.Y.Z"`
3. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
4. Publish to mavenLocal: `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`
5. Publish to Gradle Plugin Portal: `./gradlew publishPlugins`
6. Bump to next snapshot: change `version` to next patch with `-SNAPSHOT` (e.g. `0.1.2-SNAPSHOT`)
7. Commit: `git commit -am "Bump to X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT"`
8. Push: `git push && git push --tags`

## Code Structure Principles

### Separate parsing, resolution, and formatting

Code should be structured in distinct layers:

1. **Parsing** — reads raw input (bytecode, files) and produces a data structure. No formatting, no output.
2. **Resolution / matrix-building** — takes the parsed data, produces a result data structure (e.g. a `DsmMatrix`). No formatting, no I/O.
3. **Formatting** — takes the result data structure and renders it to text, HTML, etc. No dependency walking, no query logic.

Each layer is independently testable. Formatters never reach back into the parsed data to resolve more information — that belongs in the resolution layer. When two formatters (e.g. console text and HTML) need the same data, they consume the same result structure rather than independently walking the source data.

### Why this matters

- Bugs are isolated to one layer. If the matrix is wrong, it's the resolution layer. If the output looks wrong but the matrix is correct, it's the formatter.
- Adding a new output format means writing only a formatter, not duplicating resolution logic.
- Tests for each layer are fast and focused — no need for integration-level setup to test formatting.
